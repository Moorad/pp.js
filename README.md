This is a pp calculator that is fully implemented with Javascript for the new delta_t's new pp algorithm.
This was primarily made for [The Beautiful Bot](https://github.com/moorad/the-beautiful-bot) but I thought it would be a good idea to make it its own package and make it available for everyone.

Version implemented: [21c19dd](https://github.com/HeBuwei/osu/tree/21c19dd00727053df554540374cde2dd7443ef81)

This will be regularly updated as new updates roll out. Please understand that sometimes I'm busy with University and stuff and changes (especially big ones) take time to implement and test.

# Accuracy
Currently the code is not completely finished and there is a couple of minor fixes and code cleaning to do but right know SR calculation is fairly accurate (Absolute error: ± 0.000001)

For pp however there is a little issue that I havent fixed yet which is making values a lot more inaccurate than SR calculations (relative error: 0.02393%) (Absolute error: ± 1)

Keep in mind that this will keep getting updated and improved both in performance and accuracy
